Hi! My name is Misty and I live in Missoula, Montana. I am currently enrolled at Promineo Tech focusing on front-end web development. I have completed several introductory web development courses through various online institutions and am currently in the process of completing an 18-week coding boot camp dedicated to front-end web development.

I haven't had too many opportunities to showcase my work, as I am just a beginner, but I will continue to update my profile as my level of coding proficiency increases.
